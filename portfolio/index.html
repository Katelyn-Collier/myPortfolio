            <p>I am a beginner developer hoping to land an entry level job soon to jump start my career. 
             In addition to completing this portfolio with my TrueCoders experience, I am a college student majoring in aerospace engineering. 
             I hope to one day combine my coding skills with my degree to further our understanding of the universe itself.</p>

            <h1>Writing Coach at Bevill State Community College</h1>
            <p>
                During my three years as a writing coach, I learned how to lead students either one-on-one or in groups to success in their classes. 
                I taught them how to use programs like Microsoft Word and Google Docs to write their assignments. 
                I showed them how to create outlines and thesis statements, and how to draft, edit, and proofread. 
                I gained years of experience using Excel to log my time spent at work, and Office to connect with other teachers and students. 
                I gathered experience in leadership, teamwork, communication, organization, and problem-solving.
